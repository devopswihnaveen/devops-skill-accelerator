# 🏗️ Week 05 – Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

## 🎯 Week Objective
By the end of this week, learners will:
- Understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Write Terraform configurations
- Provision AWS resources using Terraform
- Manage infrastructure safely and repeatedly

---

## 🧠 What is Infrastructure as Code?
IaC allows you to **manage infrastructure using code** instead of manual steps.

Benefits:
- Version control
- Consistency
- Automation
- Easy rollback

---

## 🧰 What is Terraform?
Terraform is an IaC tool by HashiCorp used to:
- Provision infrastructure
- Manage resources across cloud providers

---

## 📦 Terraform Core Components
- Provider
- Resource
- Variable
- Output
- State file

---

## 📝 Terraform Workflow
1. Write configuration
2. `terraform init`
3. `terraform plan`
4. `terraform apply`
5. `terraform destroy`

---

## 🧪 Hands-On Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Terraform Setup
- Install Terraform
- Configure AWS credentials
- Verify installation

---

### ✅ Task 2: Create EC2 Using Terraform
- Define provider
- Create EC2 resource
- Apply configuration

---

### ✅ Task 3: State Management
- Understand `terraform.tfstate`
- Learn why state is important

---

## 🔐 Terraform Best Practices
- Never edit state manually
- Use variables
- Use remote backend
- Follow least privilege

---

## 🧠 Interview Preparation
- What is IaC?
- Why Terraform over manual setup?
- What is state file?
- Difference between plan and apply

---

## 🏁 Week 5 Outcome
- Infrastructure created using code
- Strong IaC foundation
- Ready for Kubernetes deployments
